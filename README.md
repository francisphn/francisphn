# Hello!

My name is Francis Phan. I do SWE @ Xero.

**I am interested in modern cloud, SWE and data practices:**

- Cloud-native architecture, infrastructure, IaC, observability, and security practices
- Event-driven, microservice, and serverless architectures
- Distributed systems, high availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability
- GraphQL, ASP.NET Core and how OOP and functional programming can co-exist to elegantly solve SWE problems
- Content-based recommendation systems and searching algorithms

**I'm currently playing around with...**

- AR/VR and visualisation
